# Task 1 - Create a simple TODO list.

This web app allows you to

- Display todo lists beautifully with checkboxes to indicate completion
- Save tasks in your local storage so your lists persist even after a page reload.
- Store a count of unchecked todos and display count on page as remaining tasks. (refresh page to show new count)
- The App is responsive and can be viewed with a mobile phone

You can view app in my index page in the below deploy link and by clicking on the Typescript todolist app button.
