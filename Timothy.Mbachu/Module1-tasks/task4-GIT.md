# GIT task

## Clone the internship github repo.

I have forked the repo from CIL, clone it to my local machine and created a branch which I named with ,my candidate id - **116**. This branch exists in my github profile as a repo and contains files for all the tasks assigned to me. Here is a link to my branch of the main repo with all my tasks files - https://github.com/TimmBach/cil-internship-cohort-04/tree/116
