# Introduction to UI/UX Design task

## Problem 1: Attempt the task given here - https://careerfoundry.com/en/tutorials/ux-design-for-beginners/what-is-ux-design/ Document your findings, submit your findings as a markdown file in your student folder, raise a PR.

<!-- PROBLEM 1 -->

Upon completion of the task, my findings are:

- The design thinking process is in 5 stages namely: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test. The entire process is iterative.
- The Empathize and Define phase entails understanding the problems the user is facing and determining the problem as specifically as possible.
- Ideation (or brainstorming) is either done alone or with a other designers in a group. An advantage of ideating alone is that you get to move at your speed, but ideating with other designers leads to more innovation.
- The different areas of UX design as listed in the design quadrant model are: Experience Strategy, User Research, information Architecture adn Interactive Design.
- Some important soft skills a UX designer should possess are: Communication, Empathy and Organisation.
- Every UX designer should have a portfolio where they can showcase their work to prospective employers. The portfolio should have:
  - A powerful introductory headline
  - A detailed about section.
  - Thorough case studies that detail your process.
  - Images and real artifacts.
  - Contact information and links to any additional projects (e.g. blog or social media).
- You can become a UX designer either through self-study, or enrolling a structured program.

# UI/UX Fundamentals

UX, IA, UI — all of these abbreviations can be confusing. As designers, we often find ourselves designing the overall user experience (UX), organizing information logically as we consider information architecture (IA), and considering the granular design of the user interface (UI).

## What is UI design?

UI is a vast topic, but we can break it down into phases:

- Creating an Interface Inventory
  An interface inventory is similar to a content inventory, only instead of sifting through and categorizing content, you’re taking stock and categorizing the components making up your website [or product]. An interface inventory is a comprehensive collection of the bits and pieces that make up your interface.
- Categorizing everything
  This is intended to impose some order upon the screenshots you’ve taken. You can organize your screenshots using all manner of tools, but I’d suggest organizing everything using Keynote or PowerPoint, that way you can present the work when it’s completed to your team.
- Building a pattern Library
  With your interface inventory undertaken and all of your components organized, it’s important to start to identify common UI patterns and build around them. Your interface inventory is likely to have revealed stark inconsistencies in your design, and now is the point in the design process that you address these by rebuilding your UI in a modular manner.
  The benefits of this includes: Consistency in your design, A visual vocabulary that you can share across team members and Efficiency over time as your designs develop.

When designing your UI, having a system in place that you can easily navigate through, helps to ensure that your design is consistent. And most important of all - your design has to respond to users' interactions.

## What is UX design?

UX design stands for User Experience Design. This experience is any interaction the user will have with your product. There is a wide variety of people who make use of tech products these, and the job of a UX designer is to ensure that the product meets the peculiar needs of each individual. Based on whether the design is comfortable or uncomfortable to the user, a UX design can either be a good design or a bad design.

## The UX design process

The 5 stages of the UX design thinking process are: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test.
Based on these phases, UX designers tend to follow a certain sequence for each project: carrying out user research, analyzing their findings, defining user personas, mapping out user flows, creating wireframes and prototypes, conducting user testing, and finally, handing the designs over for visual design and development.

## The UX design quadrant model

This describes the different professions and specializations obtainable to someone with UX design skills.
A great way to look at the specializations of UX design is through the lens of the quadrant model, which groups the field into four main disciplines:

- _Experience Strategy_
  This is all about devising a holistic business strategy, incorporating both the customer’s needs and those of the company.
- _User Research_
  This involves conducting both qualitative and quantitative research, gathering in-depth insights into the target users.
- _Information Architecture_
  This involves planning the IA of a new product from scratch, labelling information, and creating wireframes and taxonomies.
  The information architecture has a huge impact on how easy it is to navigate a digital product.
- _Interaction Design_
  The role of an interaction designer is very important because they look at how to reduce friction between the product and the user.

## Soft skills you need to be a good UX designer.

Soft skills are a combination of personal attributes and social and communication skills. They’re harder to measure than technical skills, but are increasingly valued in the workplace. The include the following:

- _Communication_
  UX designers spend a great deal of time presenting to clients and stakeholders, interviewing users, and collaborating with developers and fellow designers.
- _Empathy_
  Whenever decisions are being made about the direction of a product or service, it’s your role as the UX designer to advocate for the users. You need to step into the user’s shoes and view the product through their eyes.
- _Organisation_
  UX designers work with a great many documents and design deliverables—from design briefs, research findings, and interview results, to wireframes, prototypes, and design specifications. UX designers therefore need to be extremely organized.

Lastly, every UX designer has a portfolio, no matter how long they’ve been in the industry or how much experience they have. Whether you’re a brand new designer with just one project under your belt, or a seasoned expert with years in the industry, you must have a polished, up-to-date portfolio.
A UX design portfolio is an online exhibition of a UX designer’s work. It’s a personal website that introduces you as a designer and showcases a selection of projects that you’ve worked on. The aim of your UX portfolio is to demonstrate your process—not just the end result.

Your portfolio should include the following:

- A well-defined problem
- Who you worked with
- The tools and techniques you used
- The discovery phase (how you approached the problem)
- The process employed to overcome this problem (yep, that means user research, user personas, wireframing and prototyping, user testing, and visual design)
- The final outcome you reached.

An entry-level UX designer can make at least $50,000 in the US. The best time to get into UX design was yesterday, the next best time is today.
